### background
> Now more and more businesses involve social e-commerce
> Or invite to share
> But the invitation code generated by many friends is a random algorithm
> This leads to the need to query MySQL many times 
> So we specially designed this encoding scheme of invitation code
> You can use the user's' ID 'to encode
> and you can also use the encoded string to push back the' ID '`

##### In my mind, it's like this:<br/>
1. When the user registers, query the database input to see if the mobile phone exists (routine operation, no less)<br/>
2. After the mobile phone number is verified, the user login information is stored in the `login table`<br/>
3. Then use the newly added data table of `login table` to generate the invitation automatically by adding ID<br/>

###### In this way, there will be no duplicate invitation code<br/>
###### At the same time, we will not use the invitation code as a query in the future `where`<br/>
###### Because the invitation code can be pushed back `Id` <br/>

##### Generate an invitation code
```php
/** Just include it */
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode();
$app->encode(1);
```

##### Generated invitation code, number of digits
1. By default, it's six
2. Get rid of it `O` `0` `I` `1` 
3. After removing the characters that are easy to distinguish by naked eye, (26 + 10) - 4 = 32
4. It should exist:<br/>
    32 ^ 6 = 1073,741,824<br/>
    We can get a billion different invitation codes<br/>
5. However, we will need to fill in, so the default is' 30 'Dictionary characters<br/>
    30 ^ 6 = 729,000,000 `get√`<br/>
    31 ^ 6 = 887,503,681 `get√`<br/>
```php
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode(8);
$app->encode(1);
// OR
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode();
$app->setMax(8);
```

##### Modify invitation code dictionary
1. By default, it is the following dictionary
2. You can scramble the dictionary, and then the meaning of each character will change
3. `Note: ` do not modify the dictionary midway, or you need to update it in full`
```php
$dictionaries = array(
        '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9',
        'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H',
        'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'Q', 'R',
        'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X');

$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode(8, $dictionaries);
$app->encode(1);
// OR
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode();
$app->setDictionaries($dictionaries);
```

##### Modify the supplementary symbol of invitation code
1. The complement sign is the dividing line that determines the lower digit
2. Please use an array to pass in. It can be multiple
3. `Note: ` never be a character that already exists in the dictionary`
```php
$complement = array('Y', 'Z');
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode(8, arrray(), $complement);
$app->encode(1);
// OR
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode();
$app->setComplement($complement);
```

##### Encoding and decoding
```php
$app = new \NiceYu\InviteCode();

/** Get code */
$app->encode(1);

/** Untie code */
$app->decode($app->encode(1));
```
