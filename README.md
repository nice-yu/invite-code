### background
> Now more and more business involves social e-commerce, or invites to share
> However, the invitation codes generated by many friends are still random, which leads to the need for multiple queries (`Register to check duplicates`, `Register to use invitation codes to check information, etc.`)
> So we specially designed the coding scheme of this `invitation code`
> User `Id` can be used for encoding, and the encoded string can also be used to push back `Id`

##### This is what I think:<br/>
1. When the user registers, query the database to enter whether the mobile phone exists (normal operation, not less)<br/>
2. After the mobile phone number verification is correct, store the user login information in the `login table`<br/>
3. Then use the newly added data table of `LoginForm` to auto-increment `Id` to generate an invitation code<br/>

###### In this way, the invitation code will not be duplicated<br/>
###### At the same time, the invitation code will not be used as a query `where`<br/>
###### Because the invitation code can be pushed back to `Id`<br/>

##### Generate an invitation code
```php
/** Just import */
$class = new \NiceYu\InviteCode\InviteCode();
$class->encode(1);
```

##### encryption and decryption
```php
$class = new \NiceYu\InviteCode\InviteCode();

/** encryption */
$class->encode(1);

/** decryption */
$class->decode($app->encode(1));
```

##### Change the digits of generated invitation code
1. By default, it is six digits
2. Also removed `O` `0` `I` `1` `Y` `Z`
3. After removing the wrong characters that are easy to distinguish with the naked eye, (26 + 10) - 6 = 30 bit
4. Normally:<br/>
   30^6 power = 1 billion times<br/>
   We can get different 729 million invite codes<br/>
```php
$class = new \NiceYu\InviteCode\InviteCode();
$class->encode(729000000);
```

##### Modify the configuration of the invitation code
1. default the following configuration
2. You can mess up the dictionary, then the meaning of each character will change
3. `Note`: `Do not modify the dictionary midway, or you need to update it in full`
```php
$max = 6;
$complement = array('Y', 'Z');
$dictionaries = array(
    '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9',
    'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H',
    'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'Q', 'R',
    'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X'
);

$class = new \NiceYu\InviteCode\InviteCode();
$class->setMax($max)
      ->setComplement($complement)
      >setDictionaries($dictionaries);
$encode = $class->encode(1);
```

##### If other digits are required
1. Generally speaking, 6 digits are enough for large projects
2. If you need, you can modify it to 7 digits, such as for the calculation of orders, it is also possible

| bit | max           | calculation method |
|-----|---------------|--------------------|
| 5   | 2430,0000     | 30^5 power         |
| 6   | 7,2900,0000   | 30^6 power         |
| 7   | 218,7000,0000 | 30^7 power         |
